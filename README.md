# **Resilience Watch: Disaster Response Analytics**

**ResilienceWatch Analytics**, in partnership with **SafeGuard Insurance**, identified challenges in managing disaster-related insurance claims.  
After major disasters, SafeGuard faced delays in claims processing, lack of real-time insights, and fragmented data systems, resulting in poor customer experience.

To address these issues, the **Disaster Response KPI Dashboard** was developed as a **data engineering solution** to automate the ingestion, processing, and storage of disaster data while enabling **real-time KPI monitoring**.  
This allows SafeGuard Insurance to improve claims efficiency, make data-driven decisions, and enhance customer satisfaction.

## **Overview**

The Disaster Response KPI Dashboard:
- Extracts disaster project data from **FEMA APIs**
- Stores and organizes data in a **PostgreSQL database**
- Provides **real-time KPIs** for claims processing, resolution time, and customer satisfaction
- Uses **Dockerized containers** to ensure portability and consistent environments
- Includes automated **ETL pipelines** built with Python and secure handling of sensitive information via `.env` files

---

## **Project Usage**

The project can be used to:
- Automate the extraction of disaster-related data  
- Centralize claims and disaster data for analysis  
- Generate actionable KPIs for operational managers  
- Test and deploy ETL pipelines and dashboards in a containerized environment
